# prim_wrapper
 lightweight, compile-time and rust-like wrapper around the primitive numerical c++ data types

# dependencies
 [gcem](https://github.com/kthohr/gcem) - mathematical operations at compile-time  
 *optional* [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/) - integrates with fmt's formatter to make logging prim_wrapper types behave the same as their primitive counterpart
